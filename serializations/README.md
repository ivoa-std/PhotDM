## Serializations

Serializations of the photometric calibrations used by the SED builder [notebook](https://github.com/ivoa/modelinstanceinvot-code/blob/merge-syntax/photdm_impl.ipynb). 
- These serializations are based on the [syntax](https://github.com/ivoa/modelinstanceinvot-code/) still in working daft at the time of writing.
- They include X-Ray energy bands that are processed as pseudo-filters.
