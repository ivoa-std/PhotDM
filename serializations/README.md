## Serializations

VOTable Serializations of the photometric calibrations used by the example prototype proposed as reference implementation:
SED builder [notebook](https://github.com/ivoa/modelinstanceinvot-code/blob/merge-syntax/photdm_impl.ipynb). 
- These serializations are based on the [syntax](https://github.com/ivoa/modelinstanceinvot-code/) still in working draft at the time of writing.
- They include X-Ray energy bands that are processed as pseudo-filters. 

The mapping components that the serialisation document  imports are designed forllowing classes of PhotDM 1.1 , and encoded in the syntax developed for mapping instances of classes ( PhotSystem, Filter, Photcal, etc .)  as XML tags at the beginning 
of the SED document in votable format. 

These are part of this directory.
